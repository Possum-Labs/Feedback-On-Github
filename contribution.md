# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the contribution guide. There are several different ways you can help make this project betterâ€”first, report bugs. 

## Bugs
There are bugs in this code, I mean we don't know where they are, but there isn't too much code for bugs to hide. So when you see something that looks like a bug, let us know.  This project should be able to keep the number of bugs in check.

## Feature requests
The goal of this project is to be simple, small, and live inside a simple HTML page. Unfortunately, this will mean reading data, not writing it. 

Knowing this, please let us know what you'd like to see. 

## Code Reviews
This is a tiny project and Bas' first experience w/ Vue.js. So chances are it could be a lot better. Feel free to let us know how :)

## Contributing Code
First off, take a look at the code and see if you want to work on this codebase. The second thing you need is something you want to implement. Feel free to reach out to bas@possumlabs.com to set up some time to discuss the plan if you'd like. 

From a code perspective, we care about a few things. Keep it Simple; we currently have dependencies on a few large projects (Vue.js, jQueury). Our assumption is our users utilize a desktop browser, so the size is irrelevant. Leveraging these projects, we can keep the volume of maintained code as low.
