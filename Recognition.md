This tool would not exist without the work done on the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) by Microsoft.

We cannot do as much as the implementation there as we focused on making the implementation lightweight. The browsing experience is similar, but we can't support in-page data creation.
