## Recognition

This tool would not exist without the work done on the [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) by Microsoft. Although we did not have access to the [source](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/13524), the inspiration came from there. 

Our implementation is more lightweight, so there is some functionality that we can't provide. The browsing experience is similar, but we can't support in-page data creation.
