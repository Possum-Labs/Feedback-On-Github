## Try the functionality

Do you know what is better than creating issues in your repo that you'll have to clean up later? Making the issues in our repo :) This page is dedicated to people just trying the functionality, so have fun.

To create a test issue that will show up on this page, use the "This page" button below. The button will open up a custom GitHub issue where you can add some sample feedback text (please follow the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct)!). Make sure not to edit the prefilled Document Details section which associates the issue to this page. After you submit the issue, you can refresh this page, and your issue should show up as an open issue in the list.

If you comment on your issue, the comments will also show up on this page when the issue is expanded below.

### Issues associated with this page will not be worked on

If you want to get something done, submit the issue in any way other than associated with this page.
