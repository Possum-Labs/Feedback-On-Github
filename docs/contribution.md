# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the contribution guide. There are several different ways you can help make this project betterâ€”first, please report bugs!

## Bugs
There are bugs in this code, I mean we don't know where they are, but there isn't too much code for bugs to hide. So when you see something that looks like a bug, let us know.  This project should be able to keep the number of bugs in check.

## Feature requests
The goal of this project is to be simple, small, and live inside an HTML page. Unfortunately, that means we can only read data and not write it. 

Knowing that, please let us know what you'd like to see. 

## Code Reviews
This is a tiny project and Bas' first experience w/ Vue.js. So chances are it could be a lot better. Feel free to let us know how :)

## Contributing Code
To get started, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/Possum-Labs/Feedback-On-Github/tree/master/src" target="_blank">code</a> to see if you'd like to work on this codebase. If you would, the next step is to find something to implement or improve. Browsing through <a href="https://github.com/Possum-Labs/Feedback-On-Github/issues" target="_blank">open issues</a>, if there are any, could also help. Feel free to reach out to bas@possumlabs.com to set up some time to discuss the plan if you'd like. 

From a code perspective, we care about a few things: Keep it Simple and keep it accessible. We currently have dependencies on a few large projects (Vue.js and jQuery). Our assumption is that most of our users are using a desktop browser, so including these JavaScript frameworks won't noticeably affect performance. Leveraging these frameworks means that we can keep the volume of maintained code low.
